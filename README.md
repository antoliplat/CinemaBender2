CinemaBender
=====================


My first serious project. App parse RSS feed of cinema and shows info about schedule in app. 
App can also store comments and likes on films. To store this data I used Firebase storrage.
I had in plans to add reserve functionality, but cinema refused to cooperate. 

To deserialize XML used [jonnyzzz/kotlin.xml.bind](https://github.com/jonnyzzz/kotlin.xml.bind).
To load images from cinema site used [Picasso](http://square.github.io/picasso/) 

P.S. This app won't be in PlayMarket. Because I don't wont to buy a developer account.
P.P.S This app or readme might be outdated. I'm too lazy to update all of this.
